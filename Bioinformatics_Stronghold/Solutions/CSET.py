##  Fixing an Inconsistent Character Set

"""
Problem
A submatrix of a matrix M
 is a matrix formed by selecting rows and columns from M
 and taking only those entries found at the intersections of the selected rows and columns. We may also think of a submatrix as formed by deleting the remaining rows and columns from M
.

Given: An inconsistent character table C
 on at most 100 taxa.

Return: A submatrix of Câ€²
 representing a consistent character table on the same taxa and formed by deleting a single row of C
. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any one.)

Sample Dataset
100001
000110
111000
100111

Sample Output
000110
100001
100111
