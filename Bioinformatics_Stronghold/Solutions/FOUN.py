Problem
Given: Two positive integers N
 and m
, followed by an array A
 containing k
 integers between 0 and 2N
. A[j]
 represents the number of recessive alleles for the j
-th factor in a population of N
 diploid individuals.

Return: An m√ók
 matrix B
 for which Bi,j
 represents the common logarithm of the probability that after i
 generations, no copies of the recessive allele for the j
-th factor will remain in the population. Apply the Wright-Fisher model.
