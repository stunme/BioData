##  Inferring Peptide from Full Spectrum

"""
Problem
Say that we have a string s
 containing t
 as an internal substring, so that there exist nonempty substrings s1
 and s2
 of s
 such that s
 can be written as s1ts2
. A t-prefix contains all of s1
 and none of s2
; likewise, a t-suffix contains all of s2
 and none of s1
.

Given: A list L
 containing 2n+3
 positive real numbers (nâ‰¤100
). The first number in L
 is the parent mass of a peptide P
, and all other numbers represent the masses of some b-ions and y-ions of P
 (in no particular order). You may assume that if the mass of a b-ion is present, then so is that of its complementary y-ion, and vice-versa.

Return: A protein string t
 of length n
 for which there exist two positive real numbers w1
 and w2
 such that for every prefix p
 and suffix s
 of t
, each of w(p)+w1
 and w(s)+w2
 is equal to an element of L
. (In other words, there exists a protein string whose t
-prefix and t
-suffix weights correspond to the non-parent mass values of L
.) If multiple solutions exist, you may output any one.
